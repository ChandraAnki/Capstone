# EV Sales Prediction and Charging Station Optimization

## Abstract
The paper considers the rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and, consequently, the increased need for effective infrastructure planning. In this project, publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) are used to build a predictive model that forecasts EV sales and pinpoints optimal locations for new charging stations across U.S. states. The results of this analysis can assist businesses involved in the EV market, aiding in decision-making related to infrastructure development and market strategy.

## Introduction
As electric vehicles become increasingly popular, there is a significant need for supporting infrastructure. Effective planning and forecasting of EV sales, as well as optimal charging station placement, are crucial to meeting future demand. This project presents a methodology to estimate EV sales and optimize the siting of charging stations based on data from the DOE and DOT. The main challenge is developing an accurate predictive model to support EV businesses and enhance infrastructure development strategies.

## Problem Statement
With the rise in popularity of electric vehicles, the need for infrastructure planning and forecasting is greater than ever. The core objectives of this project are:
- Forecast EV sales across U.S. states.
- Recommend the development of new charging stations in locations that would best accommodate future EV sales growth.

The primary challenge is to develop a predictive model that accurately projects EV sales by region and identifies the optimal locations for new charging stations. The results will assist EV industry businesses in making informed decisions about infrastructure development and market strategy.

## Project Overview
This project involves:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering publicly available data from the DOE and DOT related to EV sales, infrastructure, and transportation statistics.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Building a model to forecast EV sales in U.S. states, considering factors such as market trends, regional demographics, and policy changes.
3. **Optimization:** Identifying the most promising areas for new charging stations based on the forecasted sales data and existing infrastructure gaps.
4. **Recommendations:** Providing insights into how businesses and government agencies can optimize investments in EV infrastructure.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Linear Programming or Genetic Algorithms (for charging station location optimization)
- **Data Sources:** U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
